Stack Machine Shell Programming

Stack Machine Shell: the most overlooked secret weapon in computer programming

Programming Languages are like religions and ideologies, garnering enthusiastic followers while fragmenting the communities without anyone being concerned at the lost of productivity that has been accumulated over the decades. 

The fragmentation of Programming communities has not been in the limelight as the absolute base of programmers has been growing literally exponentially during the past few decades, only to be met with declining profit forecast by tech giants in recent quarters. 

Amongst the hundreds of Programming Languages that have been developed over the decades, one stood out as being frequently implemented as a "shell script" within a host Programming Language -- Forth. Google "Forth" together with any other host programming language, you would find a GitHub project that implements Forth within the host programming language, from Java, JavaScript to PHP and Python. The list goes on to include Rust, Haskell, Go, C, C++, LISP and of course, the mandatory assembly language of any microprocessor. 


This would remain a mere curiosity in the relatively short history of computer programming had it not been formalized theoretically and found more useful applications. 

Formalized as inverse shunting yard algorithm
