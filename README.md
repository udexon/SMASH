# SMASH

## Stack Machine Shell Programming

### Stack Machine Shell: the Most Overlooked Secret Weapon in Computer Programming

Stack machine is one of the most fundamental mechanisms in computer systems, which can be found in places from microprocessors to programming language interpreters. 

We demonstrated that a stack machine shell (SMASH) can be implemented in high level programming languages like JavaScript and PHP with as few as around 50 lines of code, and by extension, in other equivalent high level programmming languages. SMASH operates similarly to a Forth program, using Reverse Polish Notation. It uses indirect threaded code to access all functions within the host program. Consequently, SMASH enables a host program to be modified during live execution, with complete functionalities of a debugger.

Programming Languages are like religions and ideologies, garnering enthusiastic followers while fragmenting the communities without anyone being concerned at the lost of productivity that has been accumulated over the decades. 

The fragmentation of Programming communities has not been in the limelight as the absolute base of programmers has been growing literally exponentially during the past few decades, only to be met with declining profit forecast by tech giants in recent quarters. 

Using a Forth like Reverse Polish Notation syntax, SMASH can be deployed as a "unifying script" across programming languages. 

Amongst the hundreds of Programming Languages that have been developed over the decades, Forth stood out as being frequently implemented as a "shell script" within a host Programming Language. Google "Forth" together with any other host programming language, you would find a GitHub project that implements Forth within the host programming language, from Java, JavaScript to PHP and Python. The list goes on to include Rust, Haskell, Go, C, C++, LISP and of course, the mandatory assembly language of any microprocessor. 

This would remain a mere curiosity in the relatively short history of computer programming had it not been formalized theoretically and found more useful applications. 

Formalized as inverse shunting yard algorithm

Dijkstra's 1961 paper describing the inverse shunting yard algortihm, as part of the ALGOL project, can be seen as the common ancestor of all programming language design. The inverse process, transforming Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expressions into a host programming language, can be called the "inverse shunting yard algorithm" (ISYA). We believe ours is a novel attempt to describe ISYA formally, although implementations on individual programming language have existed independently, but most, if not all, have not been developed beyond the point of demonstrating how Forth can be implemented in a host programming language.

We believe that the Forth like Reverse Polish Notation employed  in stack machine shell (SMASH) has the potential to become a "universal script" which can be learned by programmers and non-programmers alike, including mathematicians and students studying mathematics.
